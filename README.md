**BASIC CRUD APPLICATION by James E.**

- I was familiar with most of the patterns and technologies required by the 
  core element of this task, except for the in-memory database, which was 
  entirely new to me. I have previously worked with regular disk based 
  databases in PostgreSQL.js
- For the in-memory database I used LokiJS. I had considered using 
  better-SQLite3, but the documentation was not immediately clear and, given the time 
  constraints, I just needed something that worked quickly.
